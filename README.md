# mpi4py_examples
This repository is dedicated to show different ways (split.py, spit2.py, split3,py, split4.py , split,py and split6.py) to distribute a matrix (1000x4801 elements, which have been generated randomly) among several processes by using different strategies. As soon as each process has each chunk of the matrix, they compute the sum of their chunk
